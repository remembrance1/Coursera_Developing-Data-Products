## Introduction

Using the `mtcars` dataset, we can attempt to understand the relationship of various factors to gas mileage (mpg).

We plot weight (wt) vs. mileage (mpg) spatially along the x/y axes. We visualize the number of cylinders (cyl) as colors and the amount of horsepower (hp) as the size of an individual point in the plot.

## Slide with R Output

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Slide with Plot

```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(plotly))
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Car Data")
```
